## Decision Points for Planning Phase

**These questions need answers during planning:**

- [ ] Which implementation option best fits our constraints? (See "Implementation Options")
- [ ] Which existing pattern should we follow? (See "Existing Patterns Found")
- [ ] Should we reuse [component] or build new? (See "Reusable Components")
- [ ] How should we handle [identified gotcha]? (See "Common Pitfalls")
- [ ] What's our test strategy approach? (See "Testing Considerations")
- [ ] [Other decision points from discussion]

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review this research document
- [ ] Make decisions on open questions (see "Decision Points" above)
- [ ] Create implementation plan: `/rptc:plan "@[topic-slug].md"`
