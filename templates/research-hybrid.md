## Quick Wins

Items that can be addressed with minimal effort:

- [ ] [Quick win 1] - [Estimated effort: X hours]
- [ ] [Quick win 2] - [Estimated effort: X hours]

## Technical Debt to Address

Items that should be planned for but aren't blocking:

- [ ] [Debt item 1] - [Why it matters]
- [ ] [Debt item 2] - [Why it matters]

## Decision Points for Planning

**These questions need answers before implementation:**

- [ ] Which gaps should we address in this iteration?
- [ ] What's our acceptable level of deviation from best practices?
- [ ] Are there resource constraints that affect prioritization?
- [ ] [Project-specific decision point]
