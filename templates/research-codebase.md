## Architecture Overview

**Layer Structure**:
```
[Diagram or text representation of architectural layers]
```

**Data Flow**:
```
[Input] → [Processing] → [Output]
```

**Key Abstractions**:

## Code Flow

**Entry Points**:
1. `function/method:line` - [Triggered by what]
2. `function/method:line` - [Triggered by what]

**Call Chain** (trace main paths):
```
entryPoint()
  → calledFunction():line
    → nestedCall():line
      → [end result]
```

**State Transitions**:
- Initial state → [action] → New state
