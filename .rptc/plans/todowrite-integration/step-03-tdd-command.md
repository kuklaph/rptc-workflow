# Step 3: Add TodoWrite to TDD Command

## Overview

**Purpose**: Integrate TodoWrite state tracking into the TDD command with dynamic TODO generation from plan steps and quality gate tracking.

**Implementation Location**: `commands/tdd.md` - After "Phase 0: Load Plan" section

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## TDD Command Phases

The TDD command has **dynamic phases** based on plan steps:

**For each plan step**:
1. RED: Write failing tests
2. GREEN: Implement to pass tests
3. REFACTOR: Improve code quality
4. SYNC: Update plan document

**After all steps complete**:
5. REQUEST PM: Efficiency Agent approval (BLOCKING GATE)
6. EXECUTE: Efficiency Agent review
7. REQUEST PM: Security Agent approval (BLOCKING GATE)
8. EXECUTE: Security Agent review
9. REQUEST PM: Final TDD sign-off (BLOCKING GATE)
10. UPDATE: Mark plan status Complete

## Implementation Plan

### Step 3.1: Create Dynamic TodoWrite Generation

**Location**: After "Phase 0: Load Plan" (currently line ~88)

**Add new section**:

```markdown
## Step 0b: Initialize TODO Tracking

**Generate TodoWrite list dynamically from plan steps.**

### Parse Plan Document

1. Read plan document specified in command argument
2. Extract all implementation steps (look for numbered steps or checklist items)
3. Count total steps: N

### Generate TodoWrite List

For each of N plan steps, create 4 TODOs:
- Step X: RED phase
- Step X: GREEN phase
- Step X: REFACTOR phase
- Step X: SYNC plan

After all N steps, add quality gate TODOs:
- REQUEST PM: Efficiency Agent approval
- EXECUTE: Efficiency Agent review
- REQUEST PM: Security Agent approval
- EXECUTE: Security Agent review
- REQUEST PM: Final TDD sign-off
- UPDATE: Mark plan status Complete

### Example TodoWrite (3-step plan)

{
  "tool": "TodoWrite",
  "todos": [
    {"content": "Step 1: RED - Write failing tests", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Writing tests for Step 1"},
    {"content": "Step 1: GREEN - Implement to pass", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Implementing Step 1"},
    {"content": "Step 1: REFACTOR - Improve quality", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Refactoring Step 1"},
    {"content": "Step 1: SYNC - Update plan", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Syncing plan for Step 1"},

    {"content": "Step 2: RED - Write failing tests", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Writing tests for Step 2"},
    {"content": "Step 2: GREEN - Implement to pass", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Implementing Step 2"},
    {"content": "Step 2: REFACTOR - Improve quality", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Refactoring Step 2"},
    {"content": "Step 2: SYNC - Update plan", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Syncing plan for Step 2"},

    {"content": "Step 3: RED - Write failing tests", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Writing tests for Step 3"},
    {"content": "Step 3: GREEN - Implement to pass", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Implementing Step 3"},
    {"content": "Step 3: REFACTOR - Improve quality", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Refactoring Step 3"},
    {"content": "Step 3: SYNC - Update plan", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Syncing plan for Step 3"},

    {"content": "REQUEST PM: Efficiency Agent approval", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Requesting Efficiency Agent approval"},
    {"content": "EXECUTE: Efficiency Agent review", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Running Efficiency Agent"},
    {"content": "REQUEST PM: Security Agent approval", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Requesting Security Agent approval"},
    {"content": "EXECUTE: Security Agent review", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Running Security Agent"},
    {"content": "REQUEST PM: Final TDD sign-off", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Requesting final sign-off"},
    {"content": "UPDATE: Mark plan status Complete", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Updating plan status"}
  ]
}

**TodoWrite Rules**:
- Parse plan to determine N (number of steps)
- Create 4 TODOs per step (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR/SYNC)
- Add 6 quality gate TODOs at end
- Total TODOs = (N × 4) + 6
```

### Step 3.2: Add TodoWrite Updates for TDD Cycles

**For each step's RED phase**:

```markdown
**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "Step X: RED - Write failing tests" as in_progress

[Write tests first...]

**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "Step X: RED - Write failing tests" as completed
```

**For each step's GREEN phase**:

```markdown
**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "Step X: GREEN - Implement to pass" as in_progress

[Implement minimal code...]

**Auto-iteration**: If tests fail, iterate up to 10 times:
- Analyze failure
- Make targeted fix
- Re-run tests
- DO NOT create separate TODOs per iteration (aggregate in GREEN phase)

**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "Step X: GREEN - Implement to pass" as completed (when all tests pass)
```

**For each step's REFACTOR phase**:

```markdown
**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "Step X: REFACTOR - Improve quality" as in_progress

[Refactor code while keeping tests green...]

**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "Step X: REFACTOR - Improve quality" as completed
```

**For each step's SYNC phase**:

```markdown
**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "Step X: SYNC - Update plan" as in_progress

[Update plan document: mark step complete, add notes...]

**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "Step X: SYNC - Update plan" as completed
```

### Step 3.3: Add Quality Gate TodoWrite Tracking - Efficiency Agent

**Location**: After all implementation steps complete

**Add section**:

```markdown
## Phase 2: Efficiency Review

**CRITICAL - NON-NEGOTIABLE QUALITY GATE**

**TodoWrite Check**: All implementation steps must be completed before requesting Efficiency Agent

**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "REQUEST PM: Efficiency Agent approval" as in_progress

Ready for Master Efficiency Agent review?

**MUST** get PM approval - CANNOT PROCEED without efficiency review.

**Targets**:
- Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function
- Cognitive complexity <15
- Remove dead code and unused imports
- Simplify overly complex logic
- Ensure KISS and YAGNI principles

**Override**: PM may skip by saying "SKIP EFFICIENCY REVIEW - I ACCEPT THE RISKS"

Type "yes" or "approved" to proceed with efficiency review.

**After PM approval**:
- Mark "REQUEST PM: Efficiency Agent approval" as completed
- Mark "EXECUTE: Efficiency Agent review" as in_progress

**Delegate to Master Efficiency Agent**:
[Use Task tool with rptc:master-efficiency-agent...]

**After Efficiency Agent completes**:
- Mark "EXECUTE: Efficiency Agent review" as completed
```

### Step 3.4: Add Quality Gate TodoWrite Tracking - Security Agent

**Similar pattern for Security Agent**:

```markdown
## Phase 3: Security Review

**CRITICAL - NON-NEGOTIABLE QUALITY GATE**

**TodoWrite Check**: Efficiency review must be completed before requesting Security Agent

**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "REQUEST PM: Security Agent approval" as in_progress

Ready for Master Security Agent review?

**MUST** get PM approval - CANNOT PROCEED without security review.

**Coverage**:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication/authorization checks
- Dependency vulnerabilities

**Override**: PM may skip by saying "SKIP SECURITY REVIEW - I ACCEPT THE RISKS"

Type "yes" or "approved" to proceed with security review.

**After PM approval**:
- Mark "REQUEST PM: Security Agent approval" as completed
- Mark "EXECUTE: Security Agent review" as in_progress

**Delegate to Master Security Agent**:
[Use Task tool with rptc:master-security-agent...]

**After Security Agent completes**:
- Mark "EXECUTE: Security Agent review" as completed
```

### Step 3.5: Add Final Sign-Off TodoWrite Tracking

**After both quality gates**:

```markdown
## Phase 4: Final Sign-Off

**CRITICAL - CANNOT MARK TDD COMPLETE WITHOUT PM APPROVAL**

**TodoWrite Check**: Both quality gates must be completed

**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "REQUEST PM: Final TDD sign-off" as in_progress

TDD Phase Complete - Ready for commit?

All tests passing ✓
Efficiency review complete ✓
Security review complete ✓

**MUST** get final PM approval before marking implementation complete.

Type "yes" or "approved" to mark TDD complete.

**After PM approval**:
- Mark "REQUEST PM: Final TDD sign-off" as completed
- Mark "UPDATE: Mark plan status Complete" as in_progress

**Update plan document**:
[Change plan header: Status: Complete]

**Update TodoWrite**: Mark "UPDATE: Mark plan status Complete" as completed

✅ All TDD phases complete. TodoWrite list should show all tasks completed.
```
