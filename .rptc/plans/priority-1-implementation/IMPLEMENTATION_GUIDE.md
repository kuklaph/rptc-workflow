# Priority 1 Improvements - Implementation Guide

**Branch**: `feature/priority-1-improvements`
**Worktree**: `../rptc-priority-1`
**Start Date**: 2025-01-16
**Strategy**: Incremental + Compounding (Each improvement helps with the next)

---

## üéØ Mission: RPTC Self-Improvement via RPTC

Use RPTC workflow to implement Priority 1 improvements into RPTC itself, manually applying each improvement immediately after building it so it helps with the next iteration.

### Priority 1 Improvements (4 Iterations)

1. **Iteration 1**: TodoWrite Integration (60% step-skipping reduction)
2. **Iteration 2**: Plan Document Optimization (75-85% token reduction)
3. **Iteration 3**: Quality Gate Enforcement (100% compliance)
4. **Iteration 4**: Imperative Language Standardization (clarity)

**Compounding Effect**: Each iteration reduces manual overhead for the next.

---

## üìã Worktree Setup (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

```bash
# Create worktree (DONE)
git worktree add -b feature/priority-1-improvements ../rptc-priority-1

# Navigate to worktree
cd ../rptc-priority-1

# Verify location
pwd  # Should show: .../rptc-priority-1
git branch  # Should show: * feature/priority-1-improvements
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Worktree created at `../rptc-priority-1`

### Research Documents (COPIED ‚úÖ)

**Issue**: Worktree doesn't include untracked files from main worktree
**Fix**: Research documents copied to worktree

```bash
# Research documents now available (DONE)
.rptc/research/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rptc-competitive-analysis.md       (27KB) - 7 workflows comparison
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rptc-complete-workflow-analysis.md (45KB) - Comprehensive synthesis
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow-reliability-improvements.md (36KB) - TodoWrite evidence, imperative language
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ All 3 research documents available for planning phase

### Initial Commit (REQUIRED BEFORE PLANNING)

**Commit research documents to feature branch** (makes them available throughout implementation):

```bash
# In worktree: ../rptc-priority-1
git add .rptc/research/
git commit -m "docs(research): add Priority 1 research findings

- Competitive analysis (7 workflows, 50K+ stars)
- Complete RPTC workflow analysis (internal + external)
- Token optimization analysis
- TodoWrite integration evidence (Spec-Flow 60% reduction)

These research findings inform Priority 1 implementation decisions.
"
```

**Status**: ‚¨ú Not committed yet - DO THIS BEFORE PLANNING

---

## üîÑ Implementation Loop Pattern

Each iteration follows this pattern:

```
1. PLAN (using /rptc:plan)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Manual compensations active
   ‚îú‚îÄ Previous iterations auto-enabled
   ‚îî‚îÄ Output: .rptc/plans/[improvement]/

2. TDD (using /rptc:tdd)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Manual compensations active
   ‚îú‚îÄ Tests FIRST, then implementation
   ‚îî‚îÄ 100% test suite passing

3. COMMIT (using /rptc:commit)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Documentation auto-sync
   ‚îî‚îÄ Commit to feature branch

4. VALIDATE
   ‚îú‚îÄ Test the improvement works
   ‚îú‚îÄ Measure effectiveness
   ‚îî‚îÄ ENABLE for next iteration
```

## ITERATION 1: TodoWrite Integration

**Goal**: Eliminate step-skipping via persistent state tracking

### Phase 1.0: Pre-Planning Setup

- [ ] **Switch to worktree**
  ```bash
  cd ../rptc-priority-1
  ```

- [ ] **Commit research documents** (REQUIRED - provides context for planning)
  ```bash
  git add .rptc/research/
  git commit -m "docs(research): add Priority 1 research findings

  - Competitive analysis (7 workflows, 50K+ stars)
  - Complete RPTC workflow analysis (internal + external)
  - Token optimization analysis
  - TodoWrite integration evidence (Spec-Flow 60% reduction)

  These research findings inform Priority 1 implementation decisions.
  "
  ```

### Phase 1.1: Planning

- [ ] **Run planning command**
  ```bash
  /rptc:plan "Implement TodoWrite integration across all 4 core RPTC commands (research, plan, tdd, commit) with phase transition blocking. Context: This is Iteration 1 of Priority 1 improvements. Spec-Flow achieved 60% step-skipping reduction with TodoWrite. Must preserve PM-centric approval pattern and work across compaction."
  ```

- [ ] **MANUAL: Apply TodoWrite checklist during planning** (Test-drive concept)
  ```markdown
  üìù PLANNING PHASE TODOS (Track manually)

  - [ ] Research TodoWrite API and best practices
  - [ ] Review Spec-Flow implementation patterns
  - [ ] Design TodoWrite integration for /rptc:research
  - [ ] Design TodoWrite integration for /rptc:plan
  - [ ] Design TodoWrite integration for /rptc:tdd
  - [ ] Design TodoWrite integration for /rptc:commit
  - [ ] Design phase transition blocking logic
  - [ ] Define test strategy (BEFORE implementation)
  - [ ] Create acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Identify risks and dependencies
  - [ ] Master Feature Planner Agent report delivered ‚úÖ
  - [ ] Implementation plan created
  ```

- [ ] **MANUAL: Restructure plan into directory format** (Test optimization)
  ```bash
  # After Master Feature Planner delivers monolithic plan
  mkdir -p .rptc/plans/todowrite-integration

  # Split into:
  # .rptc/plans/todowrite-integration/
  # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overview.md              (~450 tokens)
  # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ step-01-research-api.md  (~200 tokens)
  # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ step-02-design.md        (~200 tokens)
  # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ step-03-impl-research.md (~200 tokens)
  # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ step-04-impl-plan.md     (~200 tokens)
  # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ step-05-impl-tdd.md      (~200 tokens)
  # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ step-06-impl-commit.md   (~200 tokens)
  # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ step-07-blocking.md      (~200 tokens)
  # ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ step-08-integration.md   (~200 tokens)
  ```

- [ ] **Verify test strategy is defined FIRST**
  - Check overview.md has complete test strategy
  - Unit tests defined
  - Integration tests defined
  - Coverage targets set (90% for TodoWrite code)

### Phase 1.2: TDD Implementation

- [ ] **Run TDD command**
  ```bash
  /rptc:tdd "@todowrite-integration/overview.md"
  ```

- [ ] **MANUAL: Track steps with TodoWrite checklist**
  ```markdown
  üìù TDD PHASE TODOS (Track manually)

  - [ ] Step 1: Research TodoWrite API (load step-01.md only)
  - [ ] Step 2: Design integration pattern (load step-02.md only)
  - [ ] Step 3: Implement /rptc:research integration (load step-03.md)
  - [ ] Step 4: Implement /rptc:plan integration (load step-04.md)
  - [ ] Step 5: Implement /rptc:tdd integration (load step-05.md)
  - [ ] Step 6: Implement /rptc:commit integration (load step-06.md)
  - [ ] Step 7: Implement blocking logic (load step-07.md)
  - [ ] Step 8: Full integration test (load step-08.md)
  - [ ] All tests passing (100%) ‚úÖ
  - [ ] [QUALITY GATE 1] Master Efficiency Agent review (MANUAL)
  - [ ] [QUALITY GATE 2] Master Security Agent review (MANUAL)
  ```

- [ ] **MANUAL: Load only overview + current step** (Test token efficiency)
  - Measure tokens: overview (450) + step (200) = 650 tokens
  - Compare to monolithic: Would be 2000+ tokens

- [ ] **MANUAL: Enforce quality gates after tests pass**
  - STOP after all tests pass
  - Manually invoke: Master Efficiency Agent (with PM approval)
  - Manually invoke: Master Security Agent (with PM approval)
  - Do NOT proceed to commit until both complete

- [ ] **MANUAL: Monitor token usage**
  - Check token count every 30 minutes
  - Compact at 80% threshold if needed
  - Preserve TodoWrite checklist (screenshot before compaction)

### Phase 1.3: Commit

- [ ] **Run commit command**
  ```bash
  /rptc:commit
  ```

- [ ] **Verify commit includes**
  - All TodoWrite integration code
  - All tests (100% passing)
  - Efficiency Agent report applied
  - Security Agent report applied
  - Documentation auto-sync from Doc Specialist

- [ ] **Git commit message**
  ```
