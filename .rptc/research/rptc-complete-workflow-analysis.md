**Research Mode**: ultrathink
**Date**: 2025-01-16
**Scope**: Comprehensive internal architecture analysis + synthesis with competitive research
**Purpose**: Final complete analysis combining all research streams

---

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes three major research streams:

1. **Internal Architecture Analysis** - Deep dive into RPTC's 14 commands, 5 agents, 6 SOPs
2. **Competitive Analysis** - Comparison with 7 top workflows (50K+ stars)
3. **Reliability Improvements Research** - TodoWrite integration, imperative language patterns

### Key Findings

**RPTC's Unique Strengths**:
- ✅ Only workflow with automated workspace versioning/migration
- ✅ PM-centric approval gates (prevents autonomous overreach)
- ✅ Comprehensive quality gates (Efficiency + Security specialists)
- ✅ SOP fallback chain (project → user → plugin flexibility)
- ✅ Intelligent documentation automation (Doc Specialist)

**Critical Gaps Identified**:
- ❌ No TodoWrite integration (60% reduction in skipped steps per Spec-Flow)
- ❌ Monolithic plan documents (1500-4500 tokens loaded per step, wasteful)
- ❌ No token budget management (auto-compact at 80% threshold)
- ❌ No phase isolation architecture (67% token reduction per Spec-Flow)
- ❌ Soft imperative language ("should", "remember" vs "MUST", "CRITICAL")

**Workflow Friction Points**:
- Step completion tracking relies on manual memory (no state persistence)
- Quality gates can be accidentally skipped in long sessions
- No forced validation at phase transitions
- Context loss across session boundaries

- Security Agent: PM approval required (quality gate)
- Documentation Specialist: **Automatic** (no approval needed)

**Thinking Mode Configuration**:
- Global default: `.claude/settings.json → rptc.defaultThinkingMode`
- Per-invocation override: User can specify when prompted
- Precedence: User choice > Global setting > Default ("think")

**SOP Consultation**:
- All agents consult SOPs via fallback chain
- Resolution order: Project → User → Plugin
- Verification: `/rptc:admin-sop-check [name]`

## Part 3: Friction Points & Pain Points Analysis

### 3.1 Step Completion Tracking (CRITICAL ISSUE)

**Problem**: No persistent state tracking for workflow steps

**Manifestation**:
- In long TDD sessions, quality gates can be accidentally skipped
- No forced checkpoint at phase transitions
- User must manually remember to invoke Efficiency/Security agents
- Documentation: "sometimes some things are skipped or missed when going through the commands step by step over long sessions"

**Current Mitigation**: Soft language in commands ("should delegate", "recommended")

**Impact**: Medium-High (affects quality assurance)

**Root Cause**: Reliance on manual memory and soft language

### 3.2 Context Loss Across Sessions (HIGH IMPACT)

**Problem**: No automatic context restoration at session boundaries

**Manifestation**:
- After compaction or new session, workflow state is lost
- User must manually invoke catch-up commands
- No TodoWrite or YAML state persistence
- Plan progress tracking is manual

**Current Mitigation**: Helper catch-up commands (manual invocation)

**Impact**: High (time wasted, context rebuilding)

**Root Cause**: No state persistence mechanism

### 3.3 Quality Gate Enforcement (MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Problem**: Efficiency and Security agents are optional (require PM approval)

**Manifestation**:
- In TDD command, gates use soft language: "If PM approves, delegate to..."
- No blocking validation forcing gate review
- User can proceed to commit without quality reviews

**Current Mitigation**: PM approval pattern (relies on user discipline)

**Impact**: Medium (quality variance depending on user diligence)

**Root Cause**: PM-centric philosophy prioritizes user control over enforcement

### 3.4 Token Budget Management (MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Problem**: No automatic token usage monitoring or compaction triggers

**Manifestation**:
- Long TDD sessions can approach token limits
- No proactive compaction at 80% threshold
- User must manually monitor context window usage
- No phase isolation to reduce token consumption

**Current Mitigation**: None (reliance on Claude Code's natural compaction)

**Impact**: Medium (context loss when auto-compaction occurs)

**Root Cause**: No token management infrastructure

### 3.5 Imperative Language Consistency (LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Problem**: Mix of soft and hard language in commands

**Examples of Soft Language**:
- "should delegate"
- "recommended"
- "if PM approves"
- "consider invoking"

**Examples of Hard Language**:
- "CRITICAL"
- "MUST"
- "NEVER"
- "REQUIRED"

**Manifestation**:
- Inconsistent enforcement of important steps
- Agents may interpret soft language as optional

**Current State**: Commands vary in language strictness

**Impact**: Low-Medium (contributes to step-skipping)

**Root Cause**: No standardized imperative language guidelines

### 3.6 Plan Document Token Inefficiency (MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT)

**Problem**: Monolithic plan documents load entire feature context for single step

**Manifestation**:
- Plan files are 1500-4500 tokens (10-20 steps combined)
- TDD loads entire plan even when only working on step 1
- 90% of plan content irrelevant to current step
- Re-reading full plan for each step = massive token waste

**Current Mitigation**: None

**Impact**: Medium-High (token efficiency, scales with feature complexity)

**Root Cause**: Monolithic plan file structure, no step-level granularity

**Token Cost Example** (10-step feature):
- Current: 1500-4500 tokens loaded per step × 10 steps = 15,000-45,000 tokens
- If optimized: 650 tokens per step × 10 steps = 6,500 tokens
- **Potential savings: 75-85%**

**2. Quality Gate Architecture** (STRONG)
- Master Efficiency Agent (KISS/YAGNI enforcement)
- Master Security Agent (OWASP audit)
- Both agents run post-TDD with test compatibility enforcement
- **Competitive Advantage**: Only Spec-Flow has code review, but no security audit

**3. Documentation Automation** (STRONG)
- Master Documentation Specialist (automatic invocation in commit phase)
- Surgical updates (preserve-first philosophy)
- Confidence-based routing (auto-update high, approve medium, flag low)
- Multi-document consistency
- **Competitive Advantage**: Unique automated doc sync approach

**4. SOP Fallback Chain** (MODERATE-STRONG)
- Project → User → Plugin resolution
- Flexible customization without forking
- Verification command (`/rptc:admin-sop-check`)
- **Competitive Advantage**: Pimzino has steering docs, but no fallback chain

**5. PM-Centric Philosophy** (MODERATE)
- Explicit approval gates for agent delegations
- User retains control over all major actions
- **Competitive Advantage**: Pimzino has approval UX, but RPTC is more systematic

### 4.3 Critical RPTC Gaps

**1. TodoWrite Integration** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Gap**: No persistent step tracking
- **Evidence**: Spec-Flow reports 60% reduction in skipped steps with TodoWrite
- **Impact**: Medium-High (quality variance, user discipline dependency)
- **Solution**: Integrate TodoWrite for phase checklists

**2. Token Budget Management** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Gap**: No auto-compact at 80% threshold
- **Evidence**: Spec-Flow implements this successfully
- **Impact**: Medium (context loss, unpredictable compaction)
- **Solution**: Monitor token usage, trigger compaction proactively

**3. Phase Isolation Architecture** (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Gap**: All phases run in same context window
- **Evidence**: Spec-Flow reports 67% token reduction with phase isolation
- **Impact**: Medium (token efficiency, context clarity)
- **Solution**: Run each phase in isolated agent context

**4. Dashboard/Progress Tracking** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Gap**: No real-time progress visualization
- **Evidence**: claude-flow (WebSocket dashboard), Pimzino (real-time UI)
- **Impact**: Low-Medium (UX improvement)
- **Solution**: Optional WebSocket-based progress dashboard

**5. Imperative Language Consistency** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Gap**: Mix of soft/hard language in commands
- **Evidence**: Reliability research recommends hard imperative keywords
- **Impact**: Low-Medium (contributes to step-skipping)
- **Solution**: Standardize on CRITICAL/MUST/NEVER/ALWAYS for key steps

**6. GitHub Integration Depth** (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Gap**: Basic gh CLI usage vs deep integration
- **Evidence**: wshobson/agents, claude-flow, Pimzino, OneRedOak have deeper GitHub integration
- **Impact**: Low-Medium (workflow efficiency)
- **Solution**: Enhanced GitHub automation (auto-PR creation, issue linking, status updates)

**7. Swarm Intelligence** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Gap**: No multi-agent parallel coordination
- **Evidence**: claude-flow implements swarm intelligence for complex tasks
- **Impact**: Low (advanced feature, not core workflow)
- **Solution**: Long-term consideration for complex features

**8. Persistent Memory System** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Gap**: No SQLite-based memory with semantic search
- **Evidence**: claude-flow has ReasoningBank memory system
- **Impact**: Low (advanced feature, not core workflow)
- **Solution**: Long-term consideration for project context persistence

## Part 5: Synthesis with Reliability Improvements Research

### 5.1 TodoWrite Integration Recommendations

**From Reliability Research**:
- TodoWrite persists across compaction and session boundaries
- Spec-Flow reports 60% reduction in skipped steps
- Provides forcing mechanism (clear incomplete todos before phase transition)

**Recommended Integration Points**:

1. **Research Phase** (`/rptc:research`):
```markdown
TodoWrite items:
- [ ] Complete research on [topic]
- [ ] Master Research Agent report delivered
- [ ] Research document created in .rptc/research/
```

2. **Planning Phase** (`/rptc:plan`):
```markdown
TodoWrite items:
- [ ] Feature requirements clarified
- [ ] Master Feature Planner Agent report delivered
- [ ] Test strategy defined
- [ ] Implementation plan created in .rptc/plans/
```

3. **TDD Phase** (`/rptc:tdd`):
```markdown
TodoWrite items:
- [ ] Step 1: [description] (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- [ ] Step 2: [description]
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Step N: [description]
- [ ] All tests passing (100%)
- [ ] [QUALITY GATE 1] Master Efficiency Agent review (with PM approval)
- [ ] [QUALITY GATE 2] Master Security Agent review (with PM approval)
```

4. **Commit Phase** (`/rptc:commit`):
```markdown
TodoWrite items:
- [ ] Test verification (enforced)
- [ ] Coverage check (enforced)
- [ ] Code quality checks (enforced)
- [ ] Master Documentation Specialist sync (automatic)
- [ ] Commit executed
- [ ] [Optional] PR created
```

**Enforcement Strategy**:
- Mark items `in_progress` when starting each step
- Mark items `completed` when finishing each step
- **BLOCK phase transition** if prior phase todos are not all `completed`
- Surface incomplete todos at phase boundaries

### 5.2 Imperative Language Standardization

**From Reliability Research**:
- Soft language ("should", "remember", "consider") leads to skipped steps
- Hard imperative keywords (CRITICAL, MUST, NEVER, ALWAYS) improve compliance

**Recommended Language Standards**:

**CRITICAL** - Blocker, cannot proceed without:
- "CRITICAL: All tests MUST pass before proceeding to Efficiency review"
- "CRITICAL: Master Documentation Specialist MUST run during commit phase"

**MUST** - Required action, workflow depends on it:
- "You MUST delegate to Master Efficiency Agent (with PM approval)"
- "Coverage MUST meet or exceed [target]%"

**NEVER** - Forbidden action:
- "NEVER skip quality gates without explicit PM override"
- "NEVER commit without running full test suite"

**ALWAYS** - Consistent expectation:
- "ALWAYS update TodoWrite when completing a step"
- "ALWAYS request PM approval before quality gate delegation"

**Refactoring Target**: Update all 14 command files with consistent imperative language

### 5.3 Conditional Worktree Integration

**From Reliability Research**:
- Worktrees provide isolation for complex features
- Should be optional based on complexity assessment

**Complexity Criteria** (from Feature Planner analysis):

**RECOMMENDED (Complex Features)**:
- Steps: ≥8
- Files: ≥15
- Time: ≥4 hours
- Risk: High
- Integration: Multiple subsystems

**OPTIONAL (Medium Features)**:
- Steps: 4-7
- Files: 5-15
- Time: 2-4 hours

**NOT NEEDED (Simple Features)**:
- Steps: ≤3
- Files: <5
- Time: <2 hours

**Integration Point**: Feature Planner should assess complexity and recommend worktree usage in plan

## Part 6: Recommended Improvements (Prioritized)

### Priority 1: CRITICAL (Immediately Implement)

**1.1 TodoWrite Integration**
- **Why**: 60% reduction in skipped steps (Spec-Flow evidence)
- **Where**: All 4 core workflow commands (research, plan, tdd, commit)
- **How**:
  - Initialize TodoWrite at phase start with checklist
  - Mark `in_progress` / `completed` as steps execute
  - Block phase transition if prior phase incomplete
- **Impact**: HIGH - Solves primary pain point (step-skipping)

**1.2 Plan Document Optimization** ⭐ ELEVATED TO PRIORITY 1
- **Why**: 75-85% token reduction on plan loading, scales with feature complexity
- **Where**: `/rptc:plan` command (Master Feature Planner Agent)
- **How**:
  - **Structure**: Directory-based plan organization
    - `.rptc/plans/feature-name/overview.md` (450 tokens: test strategy, acceptance, risks)
    - `.rptc/plans/feature-name/step-01.md` (150-240 tokens per step)
    - `.rptc/plans/feature-name/step-02.md`, etc.
  - **Integration**: TDD command loads only `overview.md` + current step (650 tokens vs 1500-4500)
  - **Works with TodoWrite**: TodoWrite tracks step completion, plan provides step details
- **Impact**: HIGH - 84-95% token savings (10-step feature: 6,500 tokens vs 15,000-45,000 tokens)

**1.3 Quality Gate Enforcement (TDD Phase)**
- **Why**: Prevents accidental quality gate skipping
- **Where**: `/rptc:tdd` command
- **How**:
  - After all tests pass, TodoWrite checklist shows:
    - `[ ] [QUALITY GATE 1] Master Efficiency Agent review`
    - `[ ] [QUALITY GATE 2] Master Security Agent review`
  - Block commit phase until both marked `completed`
  - Maintain PM approval pattern (user control preserved)
- **Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Ensures consistent quality

**1.4 Imperative Language Standardization**
- **Why**: Reduces misinterpretation, improves compliance
- **Where**: All 14 command files
- **How**:
  - Replace soft language ("should", "consider") with hard imperatives (CRITICAL, MUST, NEVER, ALWAYS)
  - Create language standards document
  - Audit all commands for consistency
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Contributes to step-skipping reduction

### Priority 2: HIGH (Implement Soon)

**2.1 Token Budget Management**
- **Why**: Prevents unpredictable compaction, maintains context
- **Where**: All long-running commands (tdd, especially)
- **How**:
  - Monitor token usage throughout command execution
  - Trigger proactive compaction at 80% threshold
  - Preserve TodoWrite state across compaction
  - Warn user when approaching limits
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Improves reliability in long sessions

**2.2 Phase Isolation Architecture**
- **Why**: 67% token reduction (Spec-Flow evidence), cleaner context
- **Where**: Core workflow (research, plan, tdd, commit)
- **How**:
  - Run each phase in isolated Task delegation
  - Pass minimal context between phases (plan file path, not entire plan)
  - Reduce parent context window usage
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Token efficiency, scalability

**2.3 Conditional Worktree Integration**
- **Why**: Isolation for complex features, avoids overhead for simple tasks
- **Where**: `/rptc:plan` command (Feature Planner recommendation)
- **How**:
  - Feature Planner assesses complexity (steps, files, time, risk)
  - Recommend worktree for complex features (≥8 steps, ≥15 files)
  - Optional for medium features
  - Skip for simple features
  - User confirms worktree usage in plan approval
- **Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM - Reduces risk for complex work

### Priority 3: MEDIUM (Future Enhancement)

**3.1 Enhanced GitHub Integration**
- **Why**: Workflow efficiency, automation
- **Where**: Commit phase, planning phase
- **How**:
  - Auto-link commits to issues (conventional commit parsing)
  - Auto-create PRs with detailed descriptions (from plan)
  - Auto-update issue status on PR merge
  - Integration with GitHub Projects for kanban tracking
- **Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM - Workflow efficiency

**3.2 Automatic Context Restoration**
- **Why**: Reduces manual catch-up invocation
- **Where**: Session boundaries, post-compaction
- **How**:
  - Detect session restart (no active todos, long time gap)
  - Auto-invoke appropriate catch-up tier based on:
    - Time since last session (2h+ → quick, 1d+ → med, 1w+ → deep)
    - TodoWrite state (many incomplete → deeper catch-up)
  - Preserve user override option
- **Impact**: LOW - Convenience feature

### Priority 4: LOW (Long-Term Consideration) ⚠️ DASHBOARD DEPRIORITIZED

**4.1 Dashboard/Progress Tracking** ⚠️ MOVED FROM PRIORITY 3
- **Why**: UX improvement, real-time visibility (optional, not currently needed)
- **Where**: Optional overlay on workflow
- **How**:
  - WebSocket-based progress dashboard (like claude-flow/Pimzino)
  - Shows phase completion, TodoWrite status, quality gate status
  - Real-time updates as workflow progresses
- **Impact**: LOW - Nice-to-have, not blocker (PM deprioritized)
- **Status**: Optional at end, focus on core workflow improvements first

**4.2 Swarm Intelligence**
- **Why**: Advanced parallelization for complex features
- **Where**: Complex multi-subsystem features
- **How**: (Long-term research needed)
  - Multi-agent parallel coordination (like claude-flow)
  - Task decomposition and delegation
  - Result synthesis
- **Impact**: LOW - Advanced feature, not core workflow

**4.3 Persistent Memory System**
- **Why**: Project context persistence across sessions
- **Where**: Cross-session knowledge retention
- **How**: (Long-term research needed)
  - SQLite-based memory store (like claude-flow ReasoningBank)
  - Semantic search over past decisions
  - Context retrieval based on current work
- **Impact**: LOW - Advanced feature, not core workflow
