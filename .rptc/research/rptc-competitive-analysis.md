## Cross-Cutting Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Real-Time Progress Tracking

**Prevalence**: 2/7 workflows (Pimzino, claude-flow)

**Implementations**:
- **Pimzino**: WebSocket dashboard with live updates
- **claude-flow**: Session status + memory stats

**RPTC Status**: ❌ Missing - No visual progress tracking

**Should RPTC Add This?**: **YES (Medium Priority)**

**Rationale**:
- Long TDD workflows benefit from visual progress
- Helps users estimate time remaining
- Useful for complex features (8+ steps)

**Implementation Options**:
1. Simple terminal-based progress bar (using TodoWrite state)
2. Optional web dashboard (requires separate server)
3. Statusline integration (Claude Code statusline API)

---

### Pattern 2: Token Budget Management

**Prevalence**: 1/7 workflows (Spec-Flow)

**Implementations**:
- **Spec-Flow**: Auto-compaction at 80% budget per phase
- **Others**: Manual /compact or no management

**RPTC Status**: ❌ Missing - Manual token management

**Should RPTC Add This?**: **YES (High Priority)**

**Rationale**:
- Long sessions hit token limits
- Auto-compaction prevents slowdowns
- Users forget to compact manually
- Aligns with "systematic" philosophy

**Implementation**:
- Monitor context size after each phase
- Auto-compact if >80% of budget (warn user first)
- Preserve key state (plan checkboxes, test results)

---

### Pattern 3: Phase Isolation Architecture

**Prevalence**: 1/7 workflows (Spec-Flow)

**Implementations**:
- **Spec-Flow**: Orchestrator delegates to phase-specific agents
- **Result**: 67% token reduction (240k → 80k per feature)

**RPTC Status**: ❌ Missing - Cumulative context across phases

**Should RPTC Add This?**: **YES (High Priority)**

**Rationale**:
- Massive token savings
- Faster execution (2-3x)
- Reduces context pollution
- Aligns with agent delegation pattern RPTC already uses

**Implementation**:
- Add `/rptc:flow "feature"` orchestrator command
- Delegates to phase agents (research-agent, plan-agent, tdd-agent, commit-agent)
- Each agent returns summary (not full context)
- User can still run phases manually for control

---

### Pattern 4: File-Based State Persistence

**Prevalence**: 1/7 workflows (Spec-Flow)

**Implementations**:
- **Spec-Flow**: workflow-state.yaml with phase tracking, quality gates, timestamps

**RPTC Status**: ❌ Missing - Markdown checkboxes only

**Should RPTC Add This?**: **MAYBE (Low Priority)**

**Rationale**:
- Machine-readable state enables automation
- Useful for blocking validation gates
- But adds complexity

**Alternative**: Use TodoWrite for state (already researched in previous doc!)

**Recommendation**: Skip YAML, rely on TodoWrite integration (simpler)

---

### Pattern 5: GitHub Integration

**Prevalence**: 2/7 workflows (claude-flow, wshobson)

**Implementations**:
- **claude-flow**: 6 specialized modes (PR, issues, repo analysis)
- **wshobson**: Git PR workflows, automated PR enhancement

**RPTC Status**: ❌ Missing - Git-agnostic

**Should RPTC Add This?**: **MAYBE (Medium Priority)**

**Rationale**:
- Many users work with GitHub
- Automates repetitive PR tasks
- But not all users use GitHub (GitLab, Bitbucket exist)

**Implementation**:
- Optional plugin or separate command
- GitHub-specific workflows (PR creation, review comments)
- Don't make it core (keep RPTC git-agnostic)

---

### Pattern 6: Versioning/Upgrade Systems

**Prevalence**: 1/7 workflows (RPTC only!)

**Implementations**:
- **RPTC**: `/rptc:admin-upgrade` with automated migration
- **Others**: npm updates, no workspace migration

**RPTC Status**: ✅ Unique Feature

**Should RPTC Keep This?**: **YES (Not Bloat, It's a Differentiator!)**

**Rationale**:
- Solves real problem (workspace staleness after plugin updates)
- Unique to RPTC
- Low cost to maintain (already built)
- Users appreciate it (no manual migration)

**Conclusion**: Versioning is **NOT bloat** - it's a competitive advantage

---

### Pattern 7: Steering Documents / Persistent Context

**Prevalence**: 2/7 workflows (Pimzino, RPTC)

**Implementations**:
- **Pimzino**: product.md, tech.md, structure.md
- **RPTC**: 6 SOPs (testing, architecture, frontend, git, languages, security)

**RPTC Status**: ✅ Has This (SOPs)

**Analysis**: **Different Approaches, Same Goal**

**Pimzino Steering Docs**:
- product.md (vision, users, objectives)
- tech.md (stack, tools, constraints)
- structure.md (file org, naming, imports)

**RPTC SOPs**:
- testing-guide.md
- architecture-patterns.md
- frontend-guidelines.md
- git-and-deployment.md
- languages-and-style.md
- security-and-performance.md

**Comparison**:
- Pimzino: Product-focused (what to build)
- RPTC: Engineering-focused (how to build)

**Should RPTC Add Product Steering?**: **MAYBE (Low Priority)**

**Rationale**:
- RPTC focuses on engineering workflow
- Product vision typically in README/docs
- But could be useful for large products

**Recommendation**: Document pattern in SOPs, let users decide
