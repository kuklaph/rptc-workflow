# Phase Transition Blocking Pattern

**Purpose**: Prevent accidental step-skipping in RPTC workflow by adding explicit validation checkpoints at critical phase transitions.

**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Active Implementation Pattern

---

## Problem Statement

The RPTC workflow has 8 critical phase transitions where PM approval or validation is required before proceeding:

1. **Research ‚Üí Save**: Must get PM sign-off on research findings
2. **Plan ‚Üí Master Planner**: Must get PM approval to delegate to Master Feature Planner
3. **Plan ‚Üí Save**: Must get final PM sign-off before saving plan
4. **TDD ‚Üí Efficiency Agent**: Must get PM approval before quality gate review
5. **TDD ‚Üí Security Agent**: Must get PM approval before security review
6. **TDD ‚Üí Complete**: Must get final PM sign-off before marking TDD complete
7. **Commit ‚Üí Execute**: Must verify all tests passing (non-negotiable)
8. **Commit ‚Üí Execute**: Must verify code quality (non-negotiable)

**Risk**: Without explicit blocking checkpoints, Claude might skip these gates or proceed without proper validation.

## Solution: Imperative Blocking Checkpoints

### Pattern Structure

Each blocking checkpoint follows this structure:

```markdown
---

**CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - [CONSEQUENCE OF SKIPPING]**

Before [action being blocked]:

**TodoWrite Check**: "[specific todo item]" MUST be completed

**Verification**:
1. [Check 1] MUST be [condition]
2. [Check 2] MUST be [condition]
3. [Check 3] MUST be [condition]

‚ùå **[GATE TYPE] BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed to [next step] without [requirement]

**Required**: [What PM/system must do]

**ENFORCEMENT**: If [condition] has NOT [occurred]:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
4. [Step 4]
5. [Step 5]
6. NEVER [skip action] without explicit override

**Override Phrase** (optional): PM may say "[EXACT OVERRIDE PHRASE]"

**This is a NON-NEGOTIABLE gate. [Rationale for why this gate exists].**

---
```

### Key Elements

1. **Imperative Language**: MUST, NEVER, CANNOT, NON-NEGOTIABLE (not "should" or "consider")
2. **TodoWrite Integration**: References specific todo item that must be completed
3. **‚ùå BLOCKED Marker**: Visual indicator that progression is stopped
4. **ENFORCEMENT Section**: Numbered steps Claude must execute
5. **Override Phrase**: Exact phrase PM can use to bypass (where applicable)
6. **Rationale**: Explains WHY this gate exists

## Implementation Locations

### Checkpoint 1: Research - Block Save Without PM Approval

**File**: `commands/research.md`
**Lines**: 347-369
**Blocks**: Saving research findings
**TodoWrite Check**: "Get PM sign-off on research"

### Checkpoint 2: Plan - Block Master Planner Delegation

**File**: `commands/plan.md`
**Lines**: 469-491
**Blocks**: Delegating to Master Feature Planner
**TodoWrite Check**: "Get PM approval for Master Feature Planner delegation"

### Checkpoint 3: Plan - Block Plan Save

**File**: `commands/plan.md`
**Lines**: 877-900
**Blocks**: Saving plan document
**TodoWrite Check**: "Get final PM sign-off"

### Checkpoint 4: TDD - Block Efficiency Agent

**File**: `commands/tdd.md`
**Lines**: 377-406
**Blocks**: Executing Master Efficiency Agent
**TodoWrite Check**: "REQUEST PM: Efficiency Agent approval"
**Override**: "SKIP EFFICIENCY REVIEW - I ACCEPT THE RISKS"

### Checkpoint 5: TDD - Block Security Agent

**File**: `commands/tdd.md`
**Lines**: 562-590
**Blocks**: Executing Master Security Agent
**TodoWrite Check**: "REQUEST PM: Security Agent approval"
**Override**: "SKIP SECURITY REVIEW - I ACCEPT THE RISKS"

### Checkpoint 6: TDD - Block TDD Completion

**File**: `commands/tdd.md`
**Lines**: 761-787
**Blocks**: Marking TDD phase complete
**TodoWrite Check**: "REQUEST PM: Final TDD sign-off"

### Checkpoint 7: Commit - Block if Tests Failing

**File**: `commands/commit.md`
**Lines**: 147-179
**Blocks**: Committing with failing tests
**Verification**: All tests must pass (automated)

### Checkpoint 8: Commit - Block if Code Quality Issues

**File**: `commands/commit.md`
**Lines**: 220-287
**Blocks**: Committing with quality violations
**Verification**: No debug code, no .env files (automated)

---

## TodoWrite Integration Requirements

Each checkpoint references a specific TodoWrite task:

```json
{
  "content": "Get PM sign-off on research",
  "status": "pending",  // Must be "completed" to pass checkpoint
  "activeForm": "Getting PM approval"
}
```

**Validation Logic**:

1. Claude checks TodoWrite list for specific task
2. If task status is NOT "completed" ‚Üí BLOCK
3. Display enforcement message
4. Wait for PM to complete task
5. Only proceed after task marked "completed"

---

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Verification Script

Location: `tests/verify-blocking-checkpoints.sh`

**What it checks**:

1. Each checkpoint exists at documented location
2. Uses imperative language (CRITICAL, MUST, NEVER, NON-NEGOTIABLE)
3. Has TodoWrite integration (references specific task)
4. Includes ‚ùå BLOCKED marker
5. Has ENFORCEMENT section

**Run validation**:

```bash
bash tests/verify-blocking-checkpoints.sh
```

**Expected output**:

```text
üîç Verifying Phase Transition Blocking Checkpoints...

=== Checkpoint 1: Research - Block Save Without PM Approval ===
‚úÖ PASS: Research Save Block - Checkpoint exists
‚úÖ PASS: Research Save Block - Uses imperative language
‚úÖ PASS: Research Save Block - TodoWrite integration verified

[... all 9 checkpoints ...]

=========================================
Test Results:
  Passed: 27
  Failed: 0
=========================================
‚úÖ All blocking checkpoints verified!
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Claude

1. **Always check TodoWrite** before proceeding at checkpoint
2. **Display ENFORCEMENT** message if task not completed
3. **Never skip** checkpoints without explicit override phrase
4. **Wait for PM** to complete required task
5. **Only proceed** when validation passes

### For Project Managers

1. **Complete TodoWrite tasks** to signal approval
2. **Use override phrases** only when you accept the risks
3. **Review enforcement messages** to understand what's being blocked
4. **Trust the gates** - they prevent costly mistakes

### For Developers

1. **Don't modify checkpoints** without updating this documentation
2. **Run validation script** after any command file changes
3. **Follow the pattern** when adding new checkpoints
4. **Update line numbers** in this doc if checkpoint locations change

---

## Adding New Checkpoints

To add a new blocking checkpoint:

1. **Identify the phase transition** that needs blocking
2. **Define TodoWrite task** that must be completed
3. **Write checkpoint** following the pattern structure above
4. **Add enforcement logic** with numbered steps
5. **Update this documentation** with new checkpoint location
6. **Add to verification script** (`tests/verify-blocking-checkpoints.sh`)
7. **Test validation** to ensure checkpoint works

---

## Rationale

**Why imperative language?**
Soft language like "should" or "consider" is easily ignored. MUST, NEVER, CANNOT create clear boundaries.

**Why TodoWrite integration?**
Explicit task completion is trackable and verifiable. No ambiguity about whether approval was given.

**Why ENFORCEMENT sections?**
Numbered steps give Claude clear instructions on what to do when blocked. No guesswork.

**Why override phrases?**
PM may have valid reasons to skip a gate. Explicit phrase ensures it's intentional, not accidental.

**Why NON-NEGOTIABLE rationale?**
Explains the "why" behind the gate, helping PM understand consequences of bypassing.

## Success Metrics

Blocking pattern is successful when:

- ‚úÖ All 8 checkpoints pass validation script
- ‚úÖ Zero accidental step-skipping incidents
- ‚úÖ PM approvals are explicitly tracked
- ‚úÖ Quality gates are never bypassed without override
- ‚úÖ TodoWrite integration provides clear approval trail
