## [1.1.9] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

- **Marketplace Plugin Detection (admin-sop-check)**: Fixed `/rptc:admin-sop-check` failing to detect marketplace-installed plugins
  - **Problem**: Same plugin detection bug as 1.1.8 but in the SOP verification command
  - **Root Cause**: Search pattern in `admin-sop-check.md` still used restrictive `"rptc-workflow"` match
  - **Impact**: Users couldn't verify SOP resolution paths when using marketplace install
  - **Solution**: Updated all three plugin search locations in `admin-sop-check.md` to use broader `"rptc"` pattern
  - **Backward Compatible**: Works with direct installs, marketplace installs, and development installs

---


## [1.1.8] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

- **Marketplace Plugin Detection**: Fixed `/rptc:admin-init` failing to detect marketplace-installed plugins
  - **Problem**: Plugin detection search pattern was too restrictive, missing marketplace-installed plugins
  - **Root Cause**: Search looked for exact plugin name `"rptc-workflow"` but marketplace plugin uses shortened name `"rptc"`
  - **Impact**: Users installing via marketplace would get "Could not locate RPTC plugin installation directory" error
  - **Solution**: Broadened search pattern to match any plugin with `"rptc"` in name
  - **Files Updated**: `commands/admin-init.md` - Updated all three plugin search locations (user plugins, system plugins, home fallback)
  - **Backward Compatible**: Still works with direct installs (`rptc-workflow`) and marketplace installs (`rptc` or `rptc-workflow-marketplace`)
  - **Detection Now Covers**:
    - Direct installs: `~/.claude/plugins/rptc-workflow/`
    - Marketplace installs: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/rptc-workflow-marketplace/`
    - Development installs: Any path with `rptc` in the name

---


## [1.1.7] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Automated Version Management (Phase 1 & 2)**: Comprehensive version synchronization automation to prevent desync issues
  - **Pre-commit Hook**: Git pre-commit hook now automatically verifies all 9 version locations before every commit
    - Creates `.git/hooks/pre-commit` script that blocks commits if versions don't match
    - Shows clear error messages indicating which locations are out of sync
    - Provides fix suggestions (`./scripts/sync-version.sh <version>`)
    - Prevents accidental version desynchronization that causes plugin installation failures
  - **Version Sync Script** (`scripts/sync-version.sh`): One-command version updates across all locations
    - Updates all 9 version locations atomically: `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json` (2×), `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (2×), `admin-init.md`, `admin-upgrade.md`
    - Creates automatic backups before changes (`.version-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`)
    - Works with or without `jq` (falls back to `sed`)
    - Validates semantic versioning format (X.Y.Z)
    - Verifies synchronization after update
    - Provides clear next steps for commit and tag creation
  - **Benefits**:
    - ✅ One command updates all 9 locations (was: 9 manual edits)
    - ✅ Pre-commit hook prevents accidental desync (was: manual check)
    - ✅ Automatic backups before changes (was: none)
    - ✅ Post-update verification (was: manual)
    - ✅ Impossible to commit with version mismatch
  - **Historical Context**: v1.0.9 was a patch release created solely because v1.0.8 forgot to update `plugin.json`. This automation prevents that class of errors entirely.
  - **Files Created**:
    - `scripts/sync-version.sh` - Automated version synchronization script (gitignored, maintainer-only)
    - `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Git hook for version verification (gitignored, auto-created per clone)

### Changed

- **Quality Gates Now Mandatory**: Removed skip options from efficiency and security reviews to enforce RPTC quality principles
  - **Problem**: Users could skip Efficiency and Security Agent reviews, bypassing quality gates
  - **Philosophy Violation**: "Never skip quality gates" is a core RPTC principle, but skip was allowed
  - **Solution**: Removed all skip options, made quality gates NON-NEGOTIABLE
  - **Impact**: Users must approve agent delegation (maintaining PM control) but cannot skip quality gates entirely
  - **Changed Prompts** (commands/tdd.md):
    - Master Efficiency Agent (Phase 2): Removed `- Type "skip" to proceed without efficiency review`
    - Master Security Agent (Phase 3): Removed `- Type "skip" to proceed without security review`
    - Added explicit warning: `**IMPORTANT**: [Agent] review is a NON-NEGOTIABLE quality gate.`
  - **Success Criteria Updated**: Changed "(or skipped)" to "(NON-NEGOTIABLE)" for both quality gates
  - **Documentation Updated**: Footer now states: "Quality gates (Efficiency & Security) are MANDATORY - PM approval required, no skipping allowed."
  - **Agent Status**:
    - Research Agent: ✅ Correctly OPTIONAL (web research only when needed)
    - Feature Planner: ✅ Already REQUIRED (marked "REQUIRED" & "CRITICAL")
    - Efficiency Agent: ✅ NOW MANDATORY (skip option removed)
    - Security Agent: ✅ NOW MANDATORY (skip option removed)
    - Documentation Specialist: ✅ Already MANDATORY (marked "CRITICAL", auto-executes)

### Fixed

- **Version Script Line Number References**: Updated all hardcoded line number references after CLAUDE.md documentation additions shifted line numbers
  - **Problem**: Sync script and pre-commit hook referenced line 186 for `_rptcVersion` example, but actual location is now line 253
  - **Root Cause**: Documentation additions in v1.1.6 shifted line numbers in CLAUDE.md
  - **Impact**: Version verification was checking wrong line, causing false negatives
  - **Solution**: Updated all references from line 186 → line 253
  - **Files Updated**:
    - `scripts/sync-version.sh`: Updated version check and output messages
    - `.git/hooks/pre-commit`: Updated version extraction command
    - `CLAUDE.md`: Updated documentation references (2 locations)
  - **Verification**: Line 253 now correctly contains `"_rptcVersion": "1.1.7"`

### Improved

- **Version Management Documentation**: Complete documentation of new automated workflow in CLAUDE.md
  - Documented pre-commit hook setup instructions
  - Documented sync script usage and benefits
  - Updated "Creating a New Release" section with streamlined workflow
  - Comparison table showing before/after for version management
- **Maintainer Experience**: Streamlined release process significantly reduces human error
  - Previous: 9 manual edits + manual verification
  - Current: 1 command + automatic verification on commit
  - Release time reduced from ~5 minutes to ~30 seconds

---


## [1.1.6] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Thinking Mode Configuration Not Loaded**: Fixed all workflow commands not loading `defaultThinkingMode` from settings.json
  - **Problem**: Users configured `"rptc.defaultThinkingMode"` in settings.json but commands always defaulted to "think" mode
  - **Root Cause**: Commands were not loading THINKING_MODE variable in Step 0/0a configuration blocks
  - **Impact**: All agent delegations (Research, Planner, Efficiency, Security, Documentation) were ignoring user's configured thinking mode preference
  - **Solution**: Standardized configuration loading pattern across all commands
    - Added `THINKING_MODE=$(jq -r '.rptc.defaultThinkingMode // "think"' ...)` to Step 0/0a in each command
    - Updated agent delegation sections to use pre-loaded `$THINKING_MODE` variable
    - Removed redundant settings.json checks later in workflow
  - **Files Updated**:
    - `commands/commit.md`: Added THINKING_MODE to Step 0, updated Phase 4 (Documentation Specialist)
    - `commands/research.md`: Added THINKING_MODE to Step 0a, updated Phase 3 (Master Research Agent)
    - `commands/plan.md`: Added THINKING_MODE to Step 0a, updated Phase 4 & 5 (Feature Planner)
    - `commands/tdd.md`: Added THINKING_MODE to Step 0a, updated Phase 2 & 3 (Efficiency + Security)
  - **User Impact**: Configured thinking mode now properly respected throughout entire RPTC workflow

### Technical

- Configuration loading now consistent: All config vars loaded once in Step 0/0a, reused via variables throughout
- Pattern: Load ALL settings upfront with jq, use bash variables downstream (eliminates redundant file reads)
- Backward compatible: Defaults unchanged, only fixes configuration not being read

---

## [1.1.5] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Sequential Planning Architecture for Complex Features**: Intelligent complexity-based planning strategy prevents Master Feature Planner timeout
  - **Problem**: Large features with many steps (>3) could cause single planning agent to timeout
  - **Solution**: Automatic complexity detection with dual-route planning strategy
    - **Simple Features** (≤3 steps): Single Master Feature Planner agent (fast, comprehensive)
    - **Complex Features** (>3 steps): Sequential planning architecture with context handoff
  - **Sequential Architecture**:
    - Analyzes scaffold complexity after PM approval
    - Creates step-specific planning agents that execute **sequentially** (not parallel)
    - Each agent receives full context from all previous step plans
    - Agent N plans Step N with knowledge of Steps 1 through N-1
    - Final coordination agent aggregates all step plans
    - Coordination agent resolves conflicts and generates integration tests
  - **Benefits**:
    - ✅ Prevents timeout on large/complex features (distributes work)
    - ✅ Maintains full coordination (each agent sees previous decisions)
    - ✅ Clean context handoff (sequential execution, not parallel)
    - ✅ Automatic conflict resolution via coordination agent
    - ✅ Integration test generation (addresses cross-step interactions)
    - ✅ Transparent to user (automatic complexity detection)
  - **File updated**: `commands/plan.md` - Added Step 2 (complexity analysis) and Step 3b (sequential agents) to Phase 5
  - **User experience**: Users see "Complex Feature Detected" message and sequential planning progress
  - **Architectural Advantage**: Sequential execution with context passing is superior to parallel execution:
    - Agents can coordinate on naming, interfaces, and file structure
    - Each agent builds on previous decisions (vs. planning in isolation)
    - Final coordination agent ensures consistency
    - No race conditions or aggregation complexity

### Changed

- **Agent Rename**: `Master Web Research Agent` → `Master Research Agent`
  - Reflects accurate scope: agent performs both web research AND codebase exploration
  - Previous name was misleading (implied web-only research)
  - Files updated:
    - `agents/master-web-research-agent.md` → `agents/master-research-agent.md`
    - `commands/research.md` - Updated delegation references
    - `README.md` - Updated agent description and directory structure

### Technical

- Sequential agent execution pattern: Agent 1 → Wait → Agent 2 (with context) → Wait → Agent 3 (with contexts 1-2) → ...
- Complexity threshold: 3 steps (configurable via simple vs. complex decision point)
- Context handoff includes: files created/modified, key decisions, dependencies, test approach
- Final coordination agent performs: conflict resolution, integration test generation, dependency consolidation

---

## [1.1.4] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Critical: Output Formatting Issue**: Fixed line-running (concatenation) issues in dynamically generated output
  - Root cause: Markdown source files were properly formatted, but output instructions lacked explicit formatting reminders
  - Claude sometimes concatenated list items during runtime (e.g., "Files Created: 7Files Modified: 3")
  - Added 40+ formatting notes across all critical output sections
  - Files updated:
    - `commands/tdd.md`: 10 formatting notes added to step reports, quality gates
    - `commands/commit.md`: 11 formatting notes added to verification summaries, PR reports
    - `commands/plan.md`: 5 formatting notes added to scaffolds, plan presentations
    - `commands/research.md`: 1 critical formatting note added to findings presentation
    - `agents/master-security-agent.md`: 9 formatting notes added to audit reports
    - `agents/master-efficiency-agent.md`: Already had critical formatting note (verified)
  - Standard formatting notes use pattern: "Each list item MUST be on its own line with proper newlines"
  - Critical sections use explicit wrong/right examples to prevent concatenation

- **Thinking Mode Approval Terminology Confusion**: Separated thinking mode configuration from approval prompts
  - Root cause: Prompts mixed approval keywords with thinking mode selection
  - Previous: "Type 'yes' to use default or 'ultrathink' for different mode" (confusing)
  - Fixed: "Type 'yes' to proceed. To override: say 'yes, use ultrathink'" (clear separation)
  - Impact: Users no longer mistake thinking mode keywords ("ultrathink") for approval terminology
  - Files updated:
    - `commands/tdd.md`: Fixed Efficiency and Security Agent delegation prompts
    - `commands/plan.md`: Fixed Master Feature Planner delegation prompt
    - `commands/research.md`: Fixed Master Web Research Agent delegation prompt
  - Thinking mode determination logic preserved: User override > Global config > Default "think"
  - All prompts now clearly show configured mode and explain override syntax separately

### Improved

- **Output Clarity**: All critical report outputs (quality gates, verification summaries, audit results) now have explicit formatting guidance to prevent line concatenation
- **Approval UX**: Clear separation between approval actions ("yes"/"approved") and optional thinking mode overrides
- **User Control**: Users retain full ability to override thinking mode per-command while avoiding terminology confusion

### Technical

- Formatting notes inserted immediately before all ```text and ```markdown output blocks where lists/multi-item displays are generated
- Thinking mode prompts restructured to show: configured mode → approval options → override syntax (as separate concerns)
- No changes to underlying thinking mode determination logic or configuration system

---

## [1.1.3] - 2025-10-15

### Changed

- **Always Create `.rptc/sop/` Directory**: The init command now always creates `.rptc/sop/` directory during workspace initialization, even without `--copy-sops` flag
  - Makes it easy for users to add their own SOPs without creating the directory manually
  - Provides consistent workspace structure across all installations
  - Directory can remain empty if user prefers to use plugin or global SOPs
  - Upgrade command now also verifies `.rptc/sop/` directory exists

### Improved

- **Clearer SOP Configuration Messaging**: Summary report now clearly indicates when `.rptc/sop/` is empty and ready for user files vs when plugin SOPs were copied

---

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-15

### Improved

- **Comprehensive Upgrade Command**: Enhanced `/rptc:admin-upgrade` to be a complete workspace verification and repair tool
  - Now performs full health check on every run, even when version is current
  - Detects and respects user customizations (directory names, config values)
  - Interactive prompts for ambiguous changes (asks before modifying potential customizations)
  - Auto-fixes clearly system-level issues (missing config fields, missing directories)
  - Verifies directory structure based on user's configured locations
  - Validates configuration file completeness
  - Checks important files (CLAUDE.md, .gitignore)
  - Validates SOP locations and fallback chain
  - Shows current configuration values for transparency

- **User Customization Detection**:
  - Detects non-standard directory names (e.g., `.rptc/archive` vs `.rptc/complete`)
  - Detects customized config values (e.g., coverage target changed from 85 to 90)
  - Asks before changing anything that might be intentional
  - Default response preserves user customizations

- **Smart Repair Logic**:
  - Auto-creates missing directories (clearly unintentional)
  - Auto-adds missing config fields (system-level only)
  - Asks before recreating deleted files (might be intentional)
  - Asks before renaming directories (might be customized naming)
  - Provides rollback instructions for all changes

### Philosophy

The upgrade command now follows a "respect user intent" philosophy:

**Auto-fix without asking**: Missing config fields, version updates, completely missing directories

**Ask first**: Directory renames, missing files, SOP location changes, any non-standard structure

**Never change silently**: Custom config values, non-standard naming, anything suggesting user preference

### Migration Notes

No migration needed from v1.1.1. The enhanced upgrade command is backward compatible and will work with any v1.0.x or v1.1.x workspace.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Windows Command Display Issue**: Fixed backslashes appearing in command names on Windows
  - Root cause: Subdirectories in `commands/` folder caused Windows path separators in command names
  - Example: `/rptc:\admin:config` appeared with backslash instead of `/rptc:admin-config`
  - Solution: Flattened directory structure - moved all commands to root `commands/` folder
  - Admin commands: `commands/admin/*.md` → `commands/admin-*.md`
  - Helper commands: `commands/helper/*.md` → `commands/helper-*.md`

### Changed

- **Plugin Name**: Shortened from `rptc-workflow` to `rptc` for more concise commands
  - Commands now use `/rptc:` prefix instead of `/rptc-workflow:`
  - Example: `/rptc-workflow:research` → `/rptc:research`
  - Shorter, cleaner command names for better UX
- **Command Naming Convention**: Established consistent dash-separated naming
  - Core workflow: `/rptc:research`, `/rptc:plan`, `/rptc:tdd`, `/rptc:commit`
  - Admin commands: `/rptc:admin-config`, `/rptc:admin-init`, `/rptc:admin-sop-check`, `/rptc:admin-upgrade`
  - Helper commands: `/rptc:helper-catch-up-quick`, `/rptc:helper-cleanup`, etc.
- **Directory Structure**: Commands now organized flat with prefixes instead of subdirectories
  - Before: `commands/admin/config.md`, `commands/helper/cleanup.md`
  - After: `commands/admin-config.md`, `commands/helper-cleanup.md`
- **Documentation**: Updated all references to new command names throughout README, CONTRIBUTING, and docs

### Migration Notes

**Upgrading from v1.1.0**:

Commands have changed names - update any scripts or documentation that reference old command names:
- `/rptc-workflow:research` → `/rptc:research`
- `/rptc-workflow:admin:config` → `/rptc:admin-config`
- `/rptc-workflow:helper:cleanup` → `/rptc:helper-cleanup`

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Version Tracking System**: Workspace now tracks plugin version via `_rptcVersion` field in settings.json
- **Automatic Upgrade Detection**: Commands can detect when workspace is outdated
- **New Command: `/rptc:admin-upgrade`**: Migrate workspace configuration when plugin updates
  - Detects version gap between workspace and plugin
  - Shows relevant changelogs
  - Merges new configuration fields while preserving user values
  - Creates backup before making changes
  - Handles version-specific migrations (e.g., SOP path migration)
  - Interactive prompts for breaking changes
  - Idempotent and safe to run multiple times

### Fixed

- **Critical: SOP Fallback Chain Bug**: Fixed bash tilde expansion issue in `/rptc:admin-sop-check`
  - User global SOPs (`~/.claude/global/sop/`) were never being found due to quoted tilde
  - Changed `"~/.claude/global/sop"` → `"$HOME/.claude/global/sop"` throughout sop-check.md
  - Impact: SOP fallback chain now works correctly at all three levels (project → user → plugin)
  - **Note**: This was a day-one bug present since v1.0.0 - user global SOPs were never functional

### Changed

- **Default SOP Path**: Changed from `.claude/sop` to `.rptc/sop` for better workspace organization
  - All RPTC files now centralized in `.rptc/` directory
  - `.rptc/sop/` - Project-specific SOPs (was `.claude/sop/`)
  - `~/.claude/global/sop/` - User global SOPs (unchanged)
  - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/sop/` - Plugin defaults (unchanged)
- **Directory Structure**: Renamed `.rptc/archive/` to `.rptc/complete/` for better semantics
  - Clearer naming for completed work
  - Updated all references in commands and documentation
- **Gitignore Behavior**: Init command no longer auto-adds `.rptc/` entries to gitignore
  - Users can choose to track research/plans in version control
  - Still auto-adds `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.claude/.env*` (Claude-specific)
- **SOP Fallback Chain**: Updated to reflect new default path
  1. Project: `.rptc/sop/` (highest priority)
  2. User: `~/.claude/global/sop/`
  3. Plugin: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/sop/`
- **Init Command** (`/rptc:admin-init`):
  - Now sets `_rptcVersion` in settings.json
  - Copies SOPs to `.rptc/sop/` instead of `.claude/sop/`
  - Creates `.rptc/sop/` directory for project-specific SOPs
- **SOP Check Command** (`/rptc:admin-sop-check`):
  - Updated to check `.rptc/sop/` first
  - Instructions updated to reference new path
- **Directory Structure**: Project SOPs now live in `.rptc/sop/` alongside other RPTC artifacts

### Improved

- **User Experience**: Centralized workspace with all RPTC files in `.rptc/`
- **Upgrade Path**: Clear migration from older versions with `/rptc:admin-upgrade`
- **Future-Proofing**: Version tracking enables smooth future upgrades
- **Workspace Organization**: Cleaner separation between Claude settings (`.claude/`) and RPTC workspace (`.rptc/`)

### Migration Notes

**Upgrading from v1.0.x**:

```bash
# Automatic upgrade (recommended)
/rptc:admin-upgrade

# Or manual steps:
# 1. Add "_rptcVersion": "1.1.0" to .claude/settings.json
# 2. Move .claude/sop/ → .rptc/sop/ (or update customSopPath)
# 3. Update customSopPath default to ".rptc/sop"
```

**For existing .claude/sop/ users**:
- Option 1: Move to `.rptc/sop/` (recommended)
- Option 2: Keep `.claude/sop/` and set `customSopPath: ".claude/sop"` in settings.json

---

## [1.0.9] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Version Synchronization**: Updated `plugin.json` version to match marketplace versions
  - Previous v1.0.8 release accidentally omitted `plugin.json` version update (remained at 1.0.6)
  - All three version locations now synchronized at 1.0.9:
    - `plugin.json` → 1.0.9
    - `marketplace.json` metadata.version → 1.0.9
    - `marketplace.json` plugins[0].version → 1.0.9
  - No functional changes; patch release for version consistency only

---

## [1.0.8] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Full Configuration System**: Complete RPTC configuration now available via `.claude/settings.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "rptc": {
      "defaultThinkingMode": "think",
      "artifactLocation": ".rptc",
      "docsLocation": "docs",
      "testCoverageTarget": 85,
      "maxPlanningAttempts": 10,
      "customSopPath": ".claude/sop"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Configurable Artifact Location** (`artifactLocation`): Users can now customize where working artifacts (research, plans, archives) are stored
- **Configurable Documentation Location** (`docsLocation`): Users can now customize where permanent documentation is stored
- **Configurable Test Coverage Target** (`testCoverageTarget`): Users can now set their own coverage threshold (default: 85%)
- **Configurable Max Planning Attempts** (`maxPlanningAttempts`): Users can now customize auto-iteration limits during TDD (default: 10)
- **Configurable SOP Path** (`customSopPath`): Users can now specify custom project-specific SOP directory location

### Changed

- **Init Command** (`/rptc:admin-init`):
  - Now creates `.claude/settings.json` with RPTC defaults on first run
  - Intelligently merges RPTC config into existing settings files
  - Summary report shows settings file creation and thinking mode tip
- **Configuration Made Functional**: All configuration options now actively used by commands:
  - **Research Phase** (`/rptc:research`): Uses `artifactLocation` for storing research documents
  - **Planning Phase** (`/rptc:plan`): Uses `artifactLocation` for storing and reading plans
  - **TDD Phase** (`/rptc:tdd`): Uses `artifactLocation` for plan synchronization AND `maxPlanningAttempts` for auto-iteration limits
  - **Commit Phase** (`/rptc:commit`): Uses `testCoverageTarget` for coverage validation AND `docsLocation` for documentation updates
  - **Cleanup Helper** (`/rptc:helper-cleanup`): Uses `artifactLocation` for archives AND `docsLocation` for promotions
- **Config Loading Pattern**: All commands now load configuration on startup with proper fallbacks to defaults

### Improved

- **Workspace Flexibility**: Users can now customize artifact and documentation locations to fit their project structure
- **Coverage Control**: Teams can now set coverage thresholds that match their quality standards
- **Iteration Control**: Users can adjust auto-iteration limits based on project complexity and time constraints

### Technical

- Implemented configuration check pattern across all command files
- Implemented consistent config loading pattern using `jq` with fallback defaults
- All hardcoded paths replaced with configuration variables (`$ARTIFACT_LOC`, `$DOCS_LOC`, `$COVERAGE_TARGET`, `$MAX_ATTEMPTS`)
- Configuration loading occurs at command startup (Step 0a) before any operations
- Backward compatibility maintained: all defaults match previous hardcoded values

---

## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Global Thinking Mode Configuration**: Users can now set a default thinking mode for all RPTC sub-agents via `.claude/settings.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "rptc": {
      "defaultThinkingMode": "think"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Thinking Mode Selection**: All sub-agent delegations now prompt users to specify thinking mode:
  - `"think"` - Basic extended thinking (~4K tokens, default)
  - `"think hard"` - Medium depth thinking (~10K tokens)
  - `"ultrathink"` - Maximum depth thinking (~32K tokens)
- **Power User Tip**: Init command now displays thinking mode configuration guidance on first setup
- **Automatic Settings Creation**: `/rptc:admin-init` now creates `.claude/settings.json` with RPTC defaults if it doesn't exist, or merges RPTC config if file exists (using `jq` if available)

### Changed

- **Default Thinking Mode**: Changed from implicit "extended" to explicit "think" (4K tokens) to be mindful of Pro plan users
- **Thinking Mode Keywords**: Updated to use official Anthropic keywords:
  - Replaced generic "extended" with "think"
  - Replaced generic "normal" with "think" (basic mode)
  - Verified "ultrathink" keyword (~32K tokens) from official sources
- **Research Phase** (`/rptc:research`):
  - Added thinking mode prompt for Master Web Research Agent delegation
  - Removed prescriptive "ultrathink" instruction from agent itself
  - Checks `.claude/settings.json` for global default before prompting
- **Planning Phase** (`/rptc:plan`):
  - Added thinking mode prompt for Master Feature Planner delegation
  - Global default used if user doesn't specify
  - Updated token budget descriptions for each mode
- **TDD Phase** (`/rptc:tdd`):
  - Added thinking mode prompt for Master Efficiency Agent delegation
  - Added thinking mode prompt for Master Security Agent delegation
  - Both agents check global configuration before prompting
- **Commit Phase** (`/rptc:commit`):
  - Master Documentation Specialist now respects global thinking mode
  - Automatically uses configured default (no prompt, as delegation is automatic)
- **Thinking Mode Precedence**: Established hierarchy: User per-command choice > Global setting > Default ("think")

### Improved

- **Token Budget Transparency**: All thinking mode tips now display approximate token budgets
- **Pro Plan Consideration**: Default mode set to "think" to avoid excessive token usage for users on Pro plans
- **Configuration Discoverability**: Init command prominently displays thinking mode configuration example

### Technical

- Verified custom configuration options are supported in Claude Code plugin settings via hierarchical settings merge
- Updated all agent delegation prompts to accept thinking mode parameter

---

2. User: `~/.claude/global/sop/` - User global defaults
3. Plugin: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/sop/` - Plugin defaults

#### Quality Enforcement Hooks

- `check-tdd.sh` - TDD warning system for implementation-first patterns
- `format-code.sh` - Auto-formatting enforcement
- `pre-commit.sh` - Comprehensive pre-commit verification
- `protect-files.sh` - Protected file guard (secrets, lock files)

#### Documentation

- `README.md` - Comprehensive plugin documentation
- `RPTC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Complete workflow guide with patterns
- `PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md` - CLAUDE.md template for user projects
- `PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `LICENSE` - MIT License

#### Templates

- `templates/research.md` - Research findings template
- `templates/plan.md` - Implementation plan template

#### Configuration

- Customizable test coverage target (default: 80%)
- Auto-promotion policy for documentation
- Retention policy for completed plans
- Max planning iteration attempts (default: 10)

### Changed

- **Plugin Architecture**: Converted from bash setup scripts to Claude Code plugin
- **Path Structure**: All plugin resources now use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for portability
- **SOP Resolution**: Implemented fallback chain instead of hardcoded paths
- **Template Handling**: Templates remain at plugin root (not copied to user projects)
- **Command Namespacing**: All commands prefixed with `/rptc:` for clarity

### Migrated

- Legacy bash setup scripts moved to `legacy/` directory
- Old `.claude/commands/.rptc/` structure converted to plugin `commands/`
- Old `.claude/agents/.rptc/` structure converted to plugin `agents/`
- Old `.rptc/sop/` moved to plugin `sop/` as defaults
- Old `.rptc/templates/` moved to plugin `templates/`

### Architecture Decisions

- **User Workspace**: `.rptc/research/`, `.rptc/plans/`, `.rptc/complete/` preserved (user artifacts)
- **Plugin Resources**: Commands, agents, SOPs, templates stay at plugin root
- **Documentation Promotion**: Automatic via Documentation Specialist (not manual prompts)
- **PM-Controlled Workflow**: Explicit approvals required at every phase transition

### Removed

- Manual bash setup scripts (replaced by plugin installation)
- Hardcoded SOP paths (replaced by fallback chain)
- Template copying to user projects (now referenced from plugin root)

## [1.0.8] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Global Thinking Mode Configuration**: Users can now set a default thinking mode for all RPTC sub-agents via `.claude/settings.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "rptc": {
      "defaultThinkingMode": "think"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Thinking Mode Selection**: All sub-agent delegations now prompt users to specify thinking mode:
  - `"think"` - Basic extended thinking (~4K tokens, default)
  - `"think hard"` - Medium depth thinking (~10K tokens)
  - `"ultrathink"` - Maximum depth thinking (~32K tokens)
- **Power User Tip**: Init command now displays thinking mode configuration guidance on first setup
- **Automatic Settings Creation**: `/rptc:admin-init` now creates `.claude/settings.json` with RPTC defaults if it doesn't exist, or merges RPTC config if file exists (using `jq` if available)
- **Full Configuration System**: Complete RPTC configuration now available via `.claude/settings.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "rptc": {
      "defaultThinkingMode": "think",
      "artifactLocation": ".rptc",
      "docsLocation": "docs",
      "testCoverageTarget": 85,
      "maxPlanningAttempts": 10,
      "customSopPath": ".claude/sop"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Configurable Artifact Location** (`artifactLocation`): Users can now customize where working artifacts (research, plans, archives) are stored
- **Configurable Documentation Location** (`docsLocation`): Users can now customize where permanent documentation is stored
- **Configurable Test Coverage Target** (`testCoverageTarget`): Users can now set their own coverage threshold (default: 85%)
- **Configurable Max Planning Attempts** (`maxPlanningAttempts`): Users can now customize auto-iteration limits during TDD (default: 10)
- **Configurable SOP Path** (`customSopPath`): Users can now specify custom project-specific SOP directory location

### Changed

- **Default Thinking Mode**: Changed from implicit "extended" to explicit "think" (4K tokens) to be mindful of Pro plan users
- **Thinking Mode Keywords**: Updated to use official Anthropic keywords:
  - Replaced generic "extended" with "think"
  - Replaced generic "normal" with "think" (basic mode)
  - Verified "ultrathink" keyword (~32K tokens) from official sources
- **Research Phase** (`/rptc:research`):
  - Added thinking mode prompt for Master Web Research Agent delegation
  - Removed prescriptive "ultrathink" instruction from agent itself
  - Checks `.claude/settings.json` for global default before prompting
- **Planning Phase** (`/rptc:plan`):
  - Added thinking mode prompt for Master Feature Planner delegation
  - Global default used if user doesn't specify
  - Updated token budget descriptions for each mode
- **TDD Phase** (`/rptc:tdd`):
  - Added thinking mode prompt for Master Efficiency Agent delegation
  - Added thinking mode prompt for Master Security Agent delegation
  - Both agents check global configuration before prompting
- **Commit Phase** (`/rptc:commit`):
  - Master Documentation Specialist now respects global thinking mode
  - Automatically uses configured default (no prompt, as delegation is automatic)
- **Thinking Mode Precedence**: Established hierarchy: User per-command choice > Global setting > Default ("think")
- **Init Command** (`/rptc:admin-init`):
  - Now creates `.claude/settings.json` with RPTC defaults on first run
  - Intelligently merges RPTC config into existing settings files
  - Summary report shows settings file creation and thinking mode tip
- **Configuration Made Functional**: All configuration options now actively used by commands:
  - **Research Phase** (`/rptc:research`): Uses `artifactLocation` for storing research documents
  - **Planning Phase** (`/rptc:plan`): Uses `artifactLocation` for storing and reading plans
  - **TDD Phase** (`/rptc:tdd`): Uses `artifactLocation` for plan synchronization AND `maxPlanningAttempts` for auto-iteration limits
  - **Commit Phase** (`/rptc:commit`): Uses `testCoverageTarget` for coverage validation AND `docsLocation` for documentation updates
  - **Cleanup Helper** (`/rptc:helper-cleanup`): Uses `artifactLocation` for archives AND `docsLocation` for promotions
- **Config Loading Pattern**: All commands now load configuration on startup with proper fallbacks to defaults

### Improved

- **Token Budget Transparency**: All thinking mode tips now display approximate token budgets
- **Pro Plan Consideration**: Default mode set to "think" to avoid excessive token usage for users on Pro plans
- **Configuration Discoverability**: Init command prominently displays thinking mode configuration example
- **Workspace Flexibility**: Users can now customize artifact and documentation locations to fit their project structure
- **Coverage Control**: Teams can now set coverage thresholds that match their quality standards
- **Iteration Control**: Users can adjust auto-iteration limits based on project complexity and time constraints

### Technical

- Verified custom configuration options are supported in Claude Code plugin settings via hierarchical settings merge
- Implemented configuration check pattern across all command files
- Updated all agent delegation prompts to accept thinking mode parameter
- Implemented consistent config loading pattern using `jq` with fallback defaults
- All hardcoded paths replaced with configuration variables (`$ARTIFACT_LOC`, `$DOCS_LOC`, `$COVERAGE_TARGET`, `$MAX_ATTEMPTS`)
- Configuration loading occurs at command startup (Step 0a) before any operations
- Backward compatibility maintained: all defaults match previous hardcoded values
